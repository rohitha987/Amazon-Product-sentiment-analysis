TITLE: Sentiment analysis on amazon product reviews

Customers freely tend to express their feedback and experiences in the review section of each product. The objective of our project is to develop a sentiment analysis system that understands and analyzes the customers sentiments from the reviews on Amazon. The system should be able to classify the reviews as positive and negative and obtain a bar graph from their sentiment score. It should be able to identify the aspects from reviews and classify them into positive aspects and negative aspects based on their polarity.

BERT base uncased model is fine-tuned for sentimental analysis.
